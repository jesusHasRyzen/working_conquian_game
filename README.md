# working_conquian_game
initial commit with already working project

The game is Conquian, or Rummy how it is better known in the U.S.
it is a 2 player game where each player will take turns to win or until all cards are drawn and there is a draw
The initially starts by requesting a username. 
  if new to the game,
    enter a 0
    then system will request your enter a new username and do so again to verify.
    the next step will be to create a password for your login
  else
    enter username and password
The game will begin by showing player1 hand and after player1 chooses their action, 
it will transition to player2 where that player will similarly choose the action to take.
This will continue until there is a winner or all cards have been drawn and no winner.
The system will also keep track of all win, losses and draws for each user.
